# Guess no Jutsu

Guess no Jutsu is a simple terminal-based guessing game where you try to name characters from various anime/manga. With different categories, difficulty levels, and some hints.



## About

I built this as my final project for the CS50P (CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python) course. It served as a hands-on learning exercise to practice Python programming fundamentals, project structure, and user interaction.



## Features

- Choose from multiple anime/manga categories  
- Three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)  
- Hints to help you guess the character  
- 5 chances per character  
- Case-insensitive input (no need to shout)  
- End-of-game score and a bit of friendly feedback
- View and delete saved scores anytime
